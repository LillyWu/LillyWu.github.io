Welcome to my webpage! 

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Laboratory for Advanced Software Systems (LASS)](https://lass.cs.umass.edu/), University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst, Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences, working with [Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/). My primary research interests focus on the **performance, reliability, and sustainability** of large-scale computing systems (e.g., edge/cloud computing), specifically concerning machine learning workloads and microservices.
 
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at TU Berlin, Germany. During my PhD, I closely worked with [Odej Kao](https://www.tu.berlin/en/dos/team/professor), [Johan Tordsson](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/johan-tordsson/), [Erik Elmroth](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/erik-elmroth/), and [Guillaume Pierre](http://www.globule.org/~gpierre/) .  My Ph.D. dissertation focused on automatic performance diagnosis and recovery for cloud microservices. My research work, MicroRCA and MicroDiag, has gained significant interest in the community and is regarded as a state-of-the-art method for many root cause analysis research projects. **The MicroRCA project is [open-sourced](https://github.com/elastisys/MicroRCA)**.

In addition to my academic achievements, I also had industrial experience as a software developer and Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud), as a data scientist in [Elastisys](https://elastisys.com/),  and as a senior research scientist in [Bosch Research](https://www.bosch.com/research/), where I researched on reliable distributed system for autonomous driving.
