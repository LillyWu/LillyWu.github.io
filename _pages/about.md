Welcome to my webpage! I am is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Laboratory for Advanced Software Systems (LASS)](https://lass.cs.umass.edu/), University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst,   Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences, working with [Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/). My primary research interests are about the **performance, reliability, security, and sustainability** of large-scale computing systems (e.g., edge/cloud computing).
 
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at TU Berlin. During my PhD, I closely worked with [Odej Kao](https://www.tu.berlin/en/dos/team/professor), [Johan Tordsson](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/johan-tordsson/), [Erik Elmroth](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/erik-elmroth/), and [Guillaume Pierre](http://www.globule.org/~gpierre/) .  My Ph.D. dissertation focused on automatic performance diagnosis and recovery for cloud microservices.

In addition to my academic achievements, I also had industrial experience in [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) as a software developer and Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), and in [Bosch Research](https://www.bosch.com/research/) as a senior research scientist, researching on reliable distributed system for autonomous driving.
