<section>
  <p>
    I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with 
    <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/" target="_blank">Prof. Prashant Shenoy</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interests lie broadly in <strong>distributed systems</strong>. I design and build systems and algorithms that enhance the  <strong>reliability</strong> and <strong>sustainability</strong> of large-scale computing through fault tolerance, performance diagnosis, and resource management. I also work on systems for AI, AI for systems, and IoT security. 
    My current research areas include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fault-Tolerant Edge AI Systems:</strong> Low-latency, resource-aware model serving on constrained edge environments (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3772052.3772243" target="_blank">SoCC 2025</a>, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10547299" target="_blank">ICCCN 2024</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10773652" target="_blank">MILCOM 2024</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reliable Cloud Microservices:</strong> Intelligent, online diagnosis and recovery from cascading failures at cloud scale (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9110353" target="_blank">NOMS 2020</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9527007" target="_blank">AIOps 2021</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9659495" target="_blank">ACSOS 2021</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sustainable Data Centers:</strong> Energy- and carbon-efficient resource management for cloud and edge data centers (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3731545.3731576" target="_blank">HPDC 2025</a>, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10540384" target="_blank">CCGrid 2024</a>).
    </li>
  </ul>


  <!-- <p>
    I also work on <strong>AI for systems</strong>, <strong>systems for AI</strong>, and <strong>IoT security</strong>, 
    with an emphasis on building deployable systems under real-world constraints. 
  </p> -->

  <p>
    I completed a <strong>Ph.D. in Computer Science</strong> at 
    <strong>Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin)</strong>, Germany, advised by 
    <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/dos/team/professor" target="_blank">Prof. Odej Kao</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.umu.se/en/staff/johan-tordsson/" target="_blank">Dr. Johan Tordsson</a>, and 
    <a href="https://www.umu.se/en/staff/erik-elmroth/" target="_blank">Prof. Erik Elmroth</a>. 
    My <a href="https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/41a16609-9269-4b00-ac8e-eb376a207399" target="_blank">dissertation</a> on automatic performance diagnosis and recovery in cloud microservices led to the <strong>MicroX</strong> series, with open-source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/elastisys/MicroRCA" target="_blank">MicroRCA</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/lillywu/sock-shop" target="_blank">a fault-injected microservices benchmark</a>. 
  </p>



  <p>
    In the past, I worked as an SRE at 
    <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud" target="_blank">IBM Cloud</a>, a 
    Systems Scientist at 
    <a href="https://elastisys.com/" target="_blank">Elastisys</a>, and a 
    Senior Research Scientist at 
    <a href="https://www.bosch.com/research/" target="_blank">Bosch Research</a>, where I gained first-hand exposure to reliability challenges in cloud and edge systems.
