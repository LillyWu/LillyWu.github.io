Welcome to my webpage! I am is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Laboratory for Advanced System Software (LASS)](https://lass.cs.umass.edu/), University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst working with [Prof. Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/). My main research interests are the ***performance, reliability, security, and sustainability*** of large-scale computing systems (e.g., edge/cloud computing).
 
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at TU Berlin. During my PhD, I closely worked with [Prof. Odej Kao](https://www.tu.berlin/en/dos/team/professor), [Prof. Johan Tordsson](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/johan-tordsson/), [Prof. Erik Elmroth](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/erik-elmroth/), and [Prof. Guillaume Pierre](http://www.globule.org/~gpierre/) .  My Ph.D. dissertation focused on automatic performance diagnosis and recovery for cloud microservices.

I also had industrial experience in IBM (Cloud) as a software developer and SRE, and in Bosch Cooperate Research as a senior research scientist, researching on edge computing for infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving.
